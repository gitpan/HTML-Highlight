HTML::Highlight - A module to highlight words or patterns in HTML documents

This module provides colour Google-style highlighting of words or
patterns in HTML documents. This feature is typically used to highlight
search results. Each specified pattern or word is highlighted using
a different color.
 
This module was originaly created to work together with fulltext
indexing module DBIx::TextIndex, but it can be used independently.

Need for a highlighter that supports wildcards and phrases and takes
HTML tags into account was my motivation to create the module.
