 HTML::Highlight - A module to highlight words or patterns in HTML documents

This module provides Google-style highlighting of words or patterns in HTML
documents. This feature is typically used to highlight search results.
 
This module was originaly created to work together with fulltext
indexing module DBIx::TextIndex.

Need for a highlighter that takes wildcard matches and HTML tags into 
account and supports czech language (or other Slavic languages) was
the motivation to create this module.
